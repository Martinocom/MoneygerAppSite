This repository is used to track issues related to the Moneyger Project, making them publicly visible. You can check the development status on the [board](https://github.com/users/Martinocom/projects/2).  

Just to be clear: this is a project I’m working on in my **free time** (_what is free time? LOL_) to learn, grow, and showcase my skills. While it started as a personal project, it’s now a real app that I and some friends use daily.  

# ❓ FAQ  

### 1. Why this project?  
I wanted to take control of my monthly budget—no ads, no tracking, no nonsense. Every app I tried felt wrong: cluttered, complicated, or just not for me. So, as a developer, I built an app *for myself*. Then, something amazing happened. I shared it, and `Android users`* loved it. That lit a spark in me. I decided to go all in: refactor, polish, test, and... release it.  

**For free. For everyone.**  

No ads. No internet connections. Your data stays yours. The app? It’s built to be lightning-fast, focused on helping us manage our budgets and save money.  

\* _If you’re a developer, you’ll understand why only `Android users` got it first! If not, [here’s why](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/81424/)._  

### 2. Where can I get it?  
The app will be available on both the Play Store and the App Store.  

It will launch first on the Play Store due to visual artifacts on the Apple side that might cause immediate app rejection _(and I want to avoid that)_.  

### 3. How much does it cost?  
- For **you**: Nothing.  
- For **me**: `100€` per year, because [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/) 🫠  

### 4. Is it secure?  
**Yes**, because:
 - All data is stored locally and is yours. I cannot access it, and neither can anyone else.  
 - You can export your data as a `.json` file and share it. From there, it’s up to you to store it securely.  
 - There are no ads, and the app doesn’t even have permission to access the internet.  
 - **100%** local. **100%** `AI`-free.  

### 5. How can I contribute?  
If you’re eager to contribute *right now*, you’ll probably find a way. But for now, I’m focused on polishing the app, so I’m avoiding extra work that might overburden me.  

### 6. WhErE iS ThE CoDE??!!1?!!  
There’s no code. It’s pure black magic 🪄, powered by hamsters 🐹.  

But here’s my promise: if this project ever becomes unmaintained or I can no longer work on it, I’ll share the full repository with complete access to the code. **That’s my pinky promise.**  

# 🤑 Direct Support  
If you’d like to help, I’d appreciate donations to cover at least the Apple Developer Program fee. It would mean a lot!

# 🤓 Nerd Stats  
Yes, this app is built with React Native. I’m an experienced React Native developer and used libraries like Reanimated and React Navigation _(you can find credits for all libraries in the app)_.  

If you’re curious about the solutions I used, feel free to ask! I’ll do my best to find time to answer.
