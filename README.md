# üåê MoneygerAppSite
The site repo for Moneyger. I have no money no time to build a proper site, so this will be the place to host any relevant news.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Useful info
This repo tracks issues of the Moneyger Project, in order to make them appear public to everyone. You can check the dev status just looking on the [board](https://github.com/users/Martinocom/projects/2). Repo of the application itself is private _(and it will stay like this)_, but you can see what I'm currently working on.

Just to be clear, this is a project that I do in my free time, for learning and to show my skills. It's not an experiment: it's a real app that I and other people (aka App Testers) personally use on daily basis. I won't break it and it I even get tired of it, all the code related will be open-sourced.

# ü§ì Nerd stats
I'm an expert React Native dev. Yes, this app is built with React Native, using some bigger libraries like Reanimated, React Navigation etc... _(just download the app, I credited every single library there)_. If you're curious about solutions I used... well, you can always ask me and I'll try to find time to answer :)
